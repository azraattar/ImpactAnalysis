Sabra Hummus,"In the US, the brand Sabra hummus was until November 2024 owned 50/50 by PepsiCo and The Strauss Group. The Strauss Group is Israel's second biggest food company and according to the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) movement it ""provides financial supportto the Israeli Defense Forces. Palestinian rights campaigners called for aboycott of Sabrasince at least 2011.In November 2024, following an intensified period ofcampaigning against the brand, it was announced that The Strauss Group was selling its stake in Sabra, leaving PepsiCo as the sole owner of the Sabra hummus brand.This appears to be a significant milestone/ partial boycott campaign success. However, PepsiCo also owns Sodastream which is subject to a BDS boycott too. Also, it's worth noting that in the UK Sabra hummus is not owned by PepsiCo, but instead by Osem Ltd, an Israeli company which is ultimately owned by Nestle.
